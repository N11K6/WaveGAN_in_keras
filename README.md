# WaveGAN in keras

The WaveGAN [https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04208] is a generative adversarial network capable of unsupervised synthesis. My current goal with this repo is to rewrite the original code, which is available on gitub [https://github.com/chrisdonahue/wavegan], through the keras API, thus offering something a bit more high-level and user-friendly for anyone to experiment with. I will also be attempting to replicate the findings of the publication to ensure the keras implementation is true to the original.
